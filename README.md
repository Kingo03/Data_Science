Data Science Assignment
Overview
This assignment is designed for beginners to get started with Data Science. You will work on a dataset to perform basic data analysis, visualization, and optional predictive modeling. The goal is to learn how to work with data step by step.

Objective
Understand and explore a dataset

Perform basic data cleaning and preprocessing

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualize trends and patterns

(Optional) Build a simple predictive model

Dataset
The dataset is not included in this repository.

To get the dataset, please message me on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/harshit-singh-1a2b18245

The dataset contains information about brief description, e.g., customer purchases, student grades, etc.

Requirements
You will need the following tools/libraries:

Python 3.x

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn (optional for modeling)

Install the required libraries using:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Tasks
Load the data
Read the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame and explore its structure.

Data Cleaning

Handle missing values

Remove duplicates

Convert data types if necessary

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, mode)

Identify trends, correlations, or patterns

Visualize the data using histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, etc.

Optional: Build a simple model

Choose a target variable

Split the data into training and testing sets

Train a simple model (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree)

Evaluate model performance

Submission
Submit a Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing your work

Include explanations for each step

Include graphs and results of your analysis

Tips for Beginners
Focus on understanding the dataset first

Visualizations are very helpful for insights

Ask questions about the data and patterns you see

Practice makes perfect!
